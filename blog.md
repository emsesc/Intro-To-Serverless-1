## About Me

My name is Matthew Morales, and I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Utah studying computer science! I first started learning to code in ninth grade, and ever since then I've loved learning everything I can about all kinds of topics including game development, computer graphics and web design. When I'm not coding, I like cooking, spending time with family and friends, and playing board games.
